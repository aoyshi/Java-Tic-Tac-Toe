# Java-Tic-Tac-Toe

The tic-tac-toe game is played on a 3 x 3 grid. 
The game is played by two players, who take turns. The first player marks moves with a 'x', the second with a 'o'.
A very simple, 2-player tictactoe game in Java running in an IDE console environment with Graphic User Interface.

The game has a very simple type of sign in in order to play the game. In main menu player can click Statistics in order
to see them, log out from the game or proceed further in the game. If the player wants to play a game with another one
then the second player has to verify himself by log in in the game. As soon as do that then the two players can
play against each other. After the end of the game the statistics of each one will be update.

For now, run the TicTacToe.java file as a simple java class in NetBeans IDE 8.1 or Eclipse and play it on the console.
